### What I learned

I've tried to create a structure of card component to enable to pass just content with styles for font and colours. Unfortunately I couldn't do that because css classes from parent component was overwriting these on ng-content (if there is any way to style them, please send me a DM).
Also I tried to set border-radius for outer container in order to easily set the nice border like it was on design sheets, but it wasn't applying ðŸ˜ž.

### Continued development

I'm really excited to expand my knowledge of Angular, especially Angular Material. From more technical POV I wanna learn more TS for more safety code and not get mad because of mistype during development ðŸ™ƒ
